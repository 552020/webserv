    <h1>About This Site</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to our Perl-based website! This site serves as a demonstration of CGI scripting with Perl, showcasing a
      simple calculator and a fun story from the tech world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our goal is to provide an educational tool that illustrates the power and flexibility of Perl for web development,
      as well as to share interesting anecdotes from the history of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether you're here to learn about Perl, explore the calculator, or just read some tech stories, we're glad you
      stopped by!
