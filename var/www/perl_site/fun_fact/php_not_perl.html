    <h1>PHP, Not PERL</h1>
    <p>
      Dustin Moskovitz, the roommate of Zuckerberg and future CTO of Facebook, eager to help out, spent a weekend
      learning Perl, thinking the website was written in Perl.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      Dustin was like, 'Hey, I want to help out.'<br />
      Zuckerberg told Moskovitz, "That's pretty cool. But you don't know any PHP."<br />
      "That weekend he went home, bought the book 'PERL for Dummies,' came back, and was like, 'OK, I'm ready to go,'"
      Zuck said, and told him, "The site's written in PHP, not PERL, dude."
