# RFC

The suggestion to "read the RFC" in the context of developing a web server, particularly one that implements the HTTP protocol, most directly refers to reading the RFCs related to the HTTP(S) protocol. This is because these documents provide the specifications and standards that govern how HTTP operates, which is fundamental to the design and functionality of a web server.

The HTTP protocol is defined in several RFCs, with the most relevant ones for modern web development being RFC 7230 through RFC 7235, as these collectively define HTTP/1.1, which is the version of the protocol in widespread use. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what each of these covers:

- **RFC 7230**: Message Syntax and Routing
- **RFC 7231**: Semantics and Content
- **RFC 7232**: Conditional Requests
- **RFC 7233**: Range Requests
- **RFC 7234**: Caching
- **RFC 7235**: Authentication

In the broader context of web server development, understanding these RFCs is essential for ensuring that your server handles requests and responses correctly, adheres to the standards for web communication, and interacts properly with clients (such as browsers and other web servers) across the internet.

However, depending on the specifics of your project or the features you plan to implement, you might also need to consider additional RFCs related to:

- **TLS/SSL (for HTTPS)**: If your server is going to support HTTPS, you would also need to look into RFCs related to TLS (Transport Layer Security), such as RFC 5246 (for TLS 1.2) and RFC 8446 (for TLS 1.3), which define the protocols used to secure communications over the internet.
- **Other Web Technologies**: If your server will support technologies such as WebSockets for real-time communication (defined in RFC 6455) or HTTP/2 (defined in RFC 7540), you would need to consult these RFCs as well.
- **Related Protocols and Technologies**: Understanding the underlying network protocols such as TCP/IP (defined in RFCs like RFC 791 for IP and RFC 793 for TCP) might also be necessary, especially for handling lower-level networking functionality.

In the context of the project description you provided, the primary interpretation of "read the RFC" is indeed to read the RFCs for the HTTP(S) protocol, focusing on those aspects that are most relevant to building a basic HTTP server. This foundational knowledge is crucial for developing a server that is compliant with web standards, capable of handling HTTP requests and responses properly, and prepared to be tested with tools like telnet and NGINX for functionality and compliance.
