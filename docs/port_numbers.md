# (Commonly used) Port numbers

These port numbers are part of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite and help identify specific services or applications running on a network. They are categorized into three ranges: Well Known Ports (0-1023), Registered Ports (1024-49151), and Dynamic/Private Ports (49152-65535). Here's a list of some well-known port numbers and their typical uses:

1. **HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol)** - Port 80: This is the default port for web traffic. Most websites use this port to serve HTTP content.

2. **HTTPS (HTTP Secure)** - Port 443: This port is used for securely transmitting web content. It encrypts the data for security, using SSL or TLS.

3. **FTP (File Transfer Protocol)**:

   - Port 20 (Data Transfer)
   - Port 21 (Command Control): FTP is used for transferring files between computers on a network.

4. **SSH (Secure Shell)** - Port 22: SSH is used for secure logins, file transfers, and port forwarding.

5. **Telnet** - Port 23: Telnet is a protocol used on the Internet or local area networks to provide a bidirectional interactive text-oriented communication facility using a virtual terminal connection.

6. **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)** - Port 25: SMTP is used to send emails.

7. **DNS (Domain Name System)** - Port 53: DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

8. **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)**:

   - Port 67 (Server)
   - Port 68 (Client): DHCP is used on networks that do not use static IP address assignment.

9. **TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol)** - Port 69: TFTP is a simple file transfer protocol, with no authentication.

10. **HTTP Alternate** - Port 8080: This is an alternate port to Port 80 for HTTP services, often used for proxy and caching, or when running multiple web servers on the same IP.

11. **POP3 (Post Office Protocol version 3)** - Port 110: POP3 is used for downloading mail to mail clients.

12. **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol)** - Port 143: IMAP is used for accessing email on a remote web server from a local client.

13. **LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol)** - Port 389: LDAP is used for accessing and maintaining distributed directory information services over an Internet Protocol network.

14. **HTTPS (HTTP Secure) alternate** - Port 8443: This is an alternate port for HTTPS, used when the default port (443) is in use or blocked.

15. **MySQL** - Port 3306: Default port for the MySQL database management system.

16. **Microsoft SQL Server** - Port 1433: Default port for Microsoft SQL Server.

These are just a few examples of the well-known port numbers and their associated services. There are many others, each serving different protocols and services across the network.
