## After a `URL` is entered into the browser, an `HTTP request` is sent

### Request string has three main components:

- request line (method, URI, and HTTP version)
- headers (content type, content length and more)
- body (html, json, plain, octet-stream)

### Notes:

- Finite state machines (FSMs) can be very helpful in parsing HTTP requests
